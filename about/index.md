The best way to learn something is to teach or in this case write it down in an accessible manner, and that's exactly what I intend to do. Anything I'm reading or learning about in computer science or anything physics related and programmable, I plan on uploading in a relatively easy way! 

Currently really interested in things such as:
* Machine learning
* Data science
* Web scraping
* Raspberry pi
* Arduino
* AI
* Cosmology

If theirs any errors please let me know! This is a sort of side project to help me hardcode some unfamiliar topics into my brain and I really don't wanna be saying the wrong things in some test..
